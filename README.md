<h2>PlantDoc Bot: Dual-Modal Disease Prediction API</h2>


# 🌱 PlantDocBot – AI-Powered Plant Disease Detection

## 1. Project Overview

PlantDocBot is an AI-powered application designed to detect plant diseases from leaf images and provide actionable recommendations. The system leverages deep learning for image classification and presents results through a user-friendly interface, helping farmers, gardeners, and agricultural students quickly identify plant health issues.

---

## 2. Problem Statement

Plant diseases significantly reduce crop yield and quality. Traditional disease identification requires expert knowledge, which is not always accessible. There is a need for an automated, fast, and reliable system that can identify plant diseases using images and provide preventive or corrective measures.

---

## 3. Objectives

* Detect plant diseases accurately using image processing and deep learning
* Provide disease name, confidence score, and treatment suggestions
* Create an easy-to-use interface for non-technical users
* Enable scalability for future plant categories and diseases

---

## 4. Features

* 📷 Image-based plant disease detection
* 🤖 Deep Learning model for classification
* 📊 Confidence score for predictions
* 💡 Disease description and treatment recommendations
* 🌐 Interactive web-based interface

---

## 5. System Architecture
